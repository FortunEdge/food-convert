# food-convert
Food convert is an app I made for a competition. This is the first actually-not-terrible app that I've made :) It converts recipies between metric and US measurments. There are also options to name the recipe, add directions, number of people served, and pieces made and export to pdf.

# Things
There's not much to this app besides a crap ton of Javascript. All the html files for the pages aren't used when the app is run, but they're useful for editing before adding to the pages.js file.
