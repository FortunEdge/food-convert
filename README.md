# food-convert
Food convert is an app I made for a competition. This is the first actually-not-terrible app that I've made :) It converts recipies between metric and US measurments. There are also options to name the recipe, add directions, number of people served, and pieces made and export to pdf.

Go to this project's page to see it running: https://fortunedge.github.io/food-convert/
